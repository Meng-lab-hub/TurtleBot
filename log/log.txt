9/19/25:

- finished 3.2 on emanual

- accidentally installed turtlebot3 desktop instead of barebone

- skipped OpenCR setup

- talking - listenning doesn't work

- failed when bring up, result of failed bring up can be seen in figure log 9/19/25.

- encounter problem (can't start up robot)
	> what happened: followed the guide, skip some part that think skipable.
		- use mobile hotspot for PI and VM
		- sometimes PI doesn't connect ot hotspot, need to edit config network file in PI mannualy (check guide).
		- need keyboard and monitor connect to PI to get pi address, after that we can ssh to PI by VM or other machine.

	> solution: ???
	> try: try re-flash ubuntu, reinstall ROS2, Turtlebot package again, follow step closely.
